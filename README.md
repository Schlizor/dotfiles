# Hey 👋

This are my dotfiles for my PC. For my 💻 please switch to the _laptop_ branch. (🚧 Work in Progress 🚧)

Currently I using on Endeavour OS as my distribution of choice after switching from Manjaro.
My Main Window Manager is Hyprland but I have also desktop environment (KDE) installed. (I am using some things from it and it is always nice to have as a fallback)

For editing text I am using Neovim (btw).

Have fun exploring, you definitely will find some issues 😄
